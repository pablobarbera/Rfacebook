\usage{
searchFacebook(string, token, n = 200, since = NULL, until = NULL)

created for version 1.0 of the Facebook Graph API will return results.}

\item{n}{Maximum number of posts to return.}

\item{since}{A UNIX timestamp or strtotime data value that points to
the start of the time range to be searched. For more information on the
accepted values, see: \url{http://php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php}}

\description{
\code{searchFacebook} retrieves public status updates that mention a given keyword
}
\details{
Note: Public post search was deprecated with version 2.0 of the Facebook Graph API,
and therefore this function will no longer work. For more information about these
changes, go to: \url{https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/changelog}

The function will only work for OAuth tokens generated with version 1.0 of the API,
which can no longer be created.

The search is performed also on the text of the comments too, which explains
why some of the returned messages do not mention the string that is being
searched.

Note that only messages up to around two weeks old or less can be returned.
