\description{
\code{getCommentReplies} retrieves the list of comments replying to 
an individual comment on a post by a public Facebook page.
}
\details{
\code{getCommentReplies} returns a list with three components: \code{comment}, 
\code{replies}, and \code{likes}. First, \code{comment} contains information
about the original comment: author, creation date, id, counts of likes and comments,
etc. Second, \code{replies} is a data frame with information about the replies
to the comment (author, message, creation time, id). Finally, \code{likes} is 
data frame that contains names and Facebook IDs of all the users that liked the comment.

Note that user information (from_id and from_name) are only returned if the token used
to authenticate is a Page access token. For more information, see: 
\url{https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.10/comment}
}
