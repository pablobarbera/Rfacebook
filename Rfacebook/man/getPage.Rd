  reactions = FALSE, verbose = TRUE, api = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{page}{A page ID or page name.}

\item{token}{Either a temporary access token created at
\url{https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer} or the OAuth token 
created with \code{fbOAuth}.}

\item{n}{Number of posts of page to return. Note that number can be sometimes
higher or lower, depending on status of API.}

\item{since}{A UNIX timestamp or strtotime data value that points to
the start of the time range to be searched. For more information on the
accepted values, see: \url{http://php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php}}

\item{until}{A UNIX timestamp or strtotime data value that points to
the end of the time range to be searched. For more information on the
accepted values, see: \url{http://php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php}}

\item{feed}{If \code{TRUE}, the function will also return posts on the page
that were made by others (not only the admin of the page).}

\item{reactions}{If \code{TRUE}, will add variables to the data frame with
the total count of reactions: love, haha, wow, sad, angry.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE}, will report a number of the posts retrieved.}

\item{api}{API version. e.g. "v2.8". \code{NULL} is the default.}
}
\description{
\code{getPage} retrieves information from a public Facebook page. Note that
information about users that have turned on the "follow" option on their 
profile can also be retrieved with this function.
}
\details{
This function will only return information from public pages, not users
with public profiles.

The \code{since} and \code{until} parameters are applied to the \code{updated_time}
field in the post objects, and not the \code{created_time}. As a result, this function
might return old posts that have been updated recently. 

\code{comments_count} refers to the total of comments, including nested comments (replies).
It might be different from the total number of comments available through the API if
some comments have been deleted.
